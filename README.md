This is a collection of notebooks covering the following areas in Natural Language Processing:

1 - Sentiment Analysis --> decide whether a comment is positive or negative

2 - Language Modeling (LM) --> next word prediction

3 - Natural Language Inference (NLI) --> determine whether a hypothesis is true, false, or undetermined given a premise

4 - Named Entity Recognition (NER) --> locate and classify named entities in unstructured text 

5 - Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) --> in this case, translation between two languages

6 - Word embeddings (word2vec) --> word vectorisation

The comments and explanations throughout the notebooks are in progress ... (sorry about that)
