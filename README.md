This is a collection of notebooks covering the following areas in Natural Language Processing:

Sentiment Analysis --> decide whether a comment is positive or negative

Language Modeling (LM) --> next word prediction

Natural Language Inference (NLI) --> determine whether a hypothesis is true, false, or undetermined given a premise

Named Entity Recognition (NER) --> locate and classify named entities in unstructured text 

Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) --> in this case, translation between two languages

Word embeddings (word2vec) --> word vectorisation
